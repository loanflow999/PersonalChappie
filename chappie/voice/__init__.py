"""Voice UX layer for the self-mod pipeline (Phase 7.4+).

`chappie/voice/` is newly introduced in Phase 7.4 — separate from the
`chappie/speech/` pipeline stack. Rationale: the echo confirmation
is a UX layer that sits between the brain tool output and TTS;
no direct audio IO. Phase 7.6 will add an adapter between
`chappie.speech.pipeline.SpeechPipeline` and `SelfModFlowController`.
