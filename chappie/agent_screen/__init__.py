"""Agent screens — a screen the agent owns, isolated from the user's desktop.

Computer-Use drives ONE physical pointer, so a background agent using it takes
the machine away from the user. An agent screen removes that trade: the agent
gets its own session (a Windows Sandbox, a virtual X display) with its own
framebuffer and its own input stream, and works there while the user keeps
typing on theirs.

Public surface:

* :mod:`~chappie.agent_screen.manager` — leases screens, one per owner.
* :mod:`~chappie.agent_screen.port` — the seam the Computer-Use engine
  perceives through; ``RealScreenPort`` preserves today's behaviour exactly.
* :mod:`~chappie.agent_screen.tools` — action tools with the SAME names as the
  desktop tools, so swapping the tool map redirects a whole mission.
